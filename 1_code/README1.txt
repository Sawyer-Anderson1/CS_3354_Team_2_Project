Project Structure Overview
  backend (/backend):
    Key files:
    main.py: The main entry point for the backend server
    matching.py: Likely contains the matching algorithm logic
    auth.py: Handles authentication and authorization
    models.py: Defines the database models
    schemas.py: Contains data validation schemas
    database.py: Database connection and configuration
    init_db.py: Database initialization script
    requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies
    alembic.ini: Configuration for database migrations
    .env.example: Template for environment variables

    Key Functionality
    The project appears to be a matching system with both web and mobile interfaces. The backend is built with Python and includes:
    Authentication System (auth.py)
    Handles user authentication and authorization
    Manages user sessions and security
    Matching Algorithm (matching.py)
    Contains the core logic for matching users or items
    Likely implements specific matching criteria and algorithms
    Database Management
    Uses SQLAlchemy (based on the presence of alembic.ini)
    Includes models for data structure
    Has migration support for database versioning
    API Layer
    The main.py file likely serves as the API entry point
    Handles routing and request processing
