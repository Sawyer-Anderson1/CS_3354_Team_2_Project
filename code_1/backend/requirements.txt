# description of the requirements:
#FastAPI (0.104.1)
#    A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python
#    Used as the main backend framework for creating RESTful APIs and web services
#Uvicorn (0.24.0)
#    An ASGI server implementation
#    Used to run the FastAPI application in production
#    Handles the actual serving of the web application
#SQLAlchemy (2.0.23)
#    A SQL toolkit and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library
#    Used for database operations and managing database models
#    Helps interact with the database in a Pythonic way
#psycopg2-binary (2.9.9)
#    PostgreSQL adapter
#    Allows Python to connect to and interact with PostgreSQL databases
#    Required for SQLAlchemy to work with PostgreSQL
#Pydantic (2.5.2)
#    Data validation library using Python type annotations
#    Used for data validation and settings management
#    Helps ensure data integrity in the application
#python-jose[cryptography] (3.3.0)
#    Library for handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
#    Used for authentication and authorization
#    The cryptography extra provides additional security features
#passlib[bcrypt] (1.7.4)
#    Password hashing library
#    Used for securely storing and verifying passwords
#    bcrypt is a secure password hashing algorithm
#python-multipart (0.0.6)
#    Library for handling form data
#    Used for processing file uploads and form submissions
#    Required for handling multipart form data in FastAPI
#websockets (12.0)
#    Library for WebSocket support
#    Enables real-time bidirectional communication
#    Used for features requiring live updates or chat functionality
#scikit-learn (1.3.2)
#    Machine learning library
#    Used for implementing machine learning algorithms
#    Suggests the application has some ML/AI features
#numpy (1.26.2)
#    Numerical computing library
#    Used for mathematical operations and array handling
#    Often used in conjunction with scikit-learn
#pandas (2.1.3)
#    Data manipulation and analysis library
#    Used for handling structured data
#    Useful for data processing and analysis
#python-dotenv (1.0.0)
#    Library for loading environment variables
#    Used for configuration management
#    Helps manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials
#pytest (7.4.3)
#    Testing framework
#    Used for writing and running tests
#    Ensures code quality and reliability
#httpx (0.25.2)
#    Modern HTTP client
#    Used for making HTTP requests
#    Useful for testing and making external API calls
#alembic (1.12.1)
#    Database migration tool
#    Used for managing database schema changes
#    Works with SQLAlchemy to handle database versioning
